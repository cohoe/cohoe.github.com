    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Fix Me Maybe (parody of Call Me Maybe)
Words by Grant Cohoe (cohoe)
Music &amp; original words by Carly Rae Jepsen</p>

<p>This was dedicated to Ross Delinger (rossdylan) because: "FIX THE DAMN IRC SERVER!" Like the original song, it then went a lot further than expected. What more might come of this?!</p>

<p>Lyrics:
```
I started as a project
Something come Fall we'd forget
The system full of neglect
But now you've logged into me.</p>

<p>Everything's been broke for awhile
It's not great R-T-P style
This wasn't supposed to be a trial
But now you've logged into me.</p>

<p>Your session was open
Bytes of logs were flowin'
Files were c-h-ownin'
Need to get them daemons going</p>

<p>I'm used to broken things
These users are crazy
But here's my address,
so fix me maybe?</p>

<p>It's hard to figure out
What is wrong here
But here's my address,
so fix me maybe?</p>

<p>I'm used to broken things
These users are crazy
But here's my address,
so fix me maybe?</p>

<p>And all the other boys
Try and break me
But here's my address,
so fix me maybe?</p>

<p>You took your time with fix
Broke in no time 'cause they're pricks
You didn't help anything
But still, you're logged in me</p>

<p>I page, and cache and write
Every morn day and night
Processor cycles aren't tight
But still, you're logged in me</p>

<p>Your session was open
Bytes of logs were flowin'
Files were c-h-ownin'
Need to get them daemons going</p>

<p>I'm used to broken things
These users are crazy
But here's my address,
so fix me maybe?</p>

<p>It's hard to figure out
What is wrong here
But here's my address,
so fix me maybe?</p>

<p>I'm used to broken things
These users are crazy
But here's my address,
so fix me maybe?</p>

<p>And all the other boys
Try and break me
But here's my address,
so fix me maybe?</p>

<p>Before you came into my logs
I was broken so bad
I was broken so bad
I was broken so so bad</p>

<p>Before you came into my logs
I was broken so bad
And you should know that
I was broken so bad</p>

<p>It's hard to figure out
What is wrong here
But here's my address,
so fix me maybe?</p>

<p>I'm used to broken things
These users are crazy
But here's my address,
so fix me maybe?</p>

<p>And all the other boys
Try and break me
But here's my address,
so fix me maybe?</p>

<p>Before you came into my logs
I was broken so bad
I was broken so bad
I was broken so so bad</p>

<p>Before you came into my logs
I was broken so bad
And you should know that</p>

<p>So fix me, maybe?
