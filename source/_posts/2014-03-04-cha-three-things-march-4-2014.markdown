## Farewell, old friend
This weekend was a bittersweet moment for RIT. After sweeping
Penn State in the first round of the CHA playoffs, the Tigers
had to say farewell to Ritter Arena, their home since the 
programs inception in 1975. Next season the Tigers will take to
the ice in the 4200-seat Gene Polisseni Center in September.
After the handshake, the team circled up and took a knee at 
center ice for one final salute to Ritter. I'll be honest. I 
shed a tear.

## Penn State [repeat]
For the second straight season, Penn State finished with
a single win under their belt (each time against Lindenwood).
They also finished last in the CHA and had their seasons
come to a close at the hands of RIT at Ritter Arena. Next 
season the Nittany Lions will return 7 of their 8 top goal
scorers as sophomores/juniors. Freshman Laura Bowman is 
reponsible for 10 goals and 6 assists on 90 shots, good enough
for 2nd best percentage. Sophomore Shannon Yoxheimer ended her 
season 2nd with 8 goals, 8 assists on 197 shots. Not an ideal 
percentage but no coach can fault her for putting the puck on
net.

## Team Goal
Syracuse had a nifty little move to open up scoring on 
Saturday. All five skaters touched the puck, eventually
connecting with Julie Knerr's stick which whipped it 
past the Lindenwood goaltender for the first goal of the
game. This would be all the Orange would need as Jenesica 
Drinkwater held on for the remaining 59:00 to get the 
donut.
