Fix Me Maybe (parody of Call Me Maybe)
Words by Grant Cohoe (cohoe)
Music & original words by Carly Rae Jepsen

This was dedicated to Ross Delinger (rossdylan) because: "FIX THE DAMN IRC SERVER!" Like the original song, it then went a lot further than expected. What more might come of this?!

Lyrics:
```
I started as a project
Something come Fall we'd forget
The system full of neglect
But now you've logged into me.

Everything's been broke for awhile
It's not great R-T-P style
This wasn't supposed to be a trial
But now you've logged into me.

Your session was open
Bytes of logs were flowin'
Files were c-h-ownin'
Need to get them daemons going

I'm used to broken things
These users are crazy
But here's my address, 
so fix me maybe?

It's hard to figure out
What is wrong here
But here's my address, 
so fix me maybe?

I'm used to broken things
These users are crazy
But here's my address, 
so fix me maybe?

And all the other boys
Try and break me
But here's my address,
so fix me maybe?

You took your time with fix
Broke in no time 'cause they're pricks
You didn't help anything
But still, you're logged in me

I page, and cache and write
Every morn day and night
Processor cycles aren't tight
But still, you're logged in me

Your session was open
Bytes of logs were flowin'
Files were c-h-ownin'
Need to get them daemons going

I'm used to broken things
These users are crazy
But here's my address, 
so fix me maybe?

It's hard to figure out
What is wrong here
But here's my address, 
so fix me maybe?

I'm used to broken things
These users are crazy
But here's my address, 
so fix me maybe?

And all the other boys
Try and break me
But here's my address,
so fix me maybe?

Before you came into my logs 
I was broken so bad
I was broken so bad
I was broken so so bad

Before you came into my logs 
I was broken so bad
And you should know that
I was broken so bad

It's hard to figure out
What is wrong here
But here's my address, 
so fix me maybe?

I'm used to broken things
These users are crazy
But here's my address, 
so fix me maybe?

And all the other boys
Try and break me
But here's my address,
so fix me maybe?

Before you came into my logs 
I was broken so bad
I was broken so bad
I was broken so so bad

Before you came into my logs 
I was broken so bad
And you should know that

So fix me, maybe?
```
