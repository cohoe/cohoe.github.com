## Semifinals

### No. 4 Syracuse vs. No 1 Mercyhurst
Syracuse has been unable to solve Mercyhurst in their entire D-I history, getting at best one tie each season. After getting swept by RIT to end the regular season I don't think anything is going to change.<br>
__Mercyhurst Wins 5-2__

### No. 3 RIT vs. No 2 Robert Morris
The Tigers will need to bring their A-game if they want to keep this to a 1-goal contest. I've seen that level of play from them before, but after seeing a C-game on Friday and a B+-game Saturday I don't think it's going to happen.<br>
__Robert Morris Wins 3-1__

## Final

### No. 2 Robert Morris vs. No. 1 Mercyhurst
The Colonials have been the only team to seriously challenge the Lakers in conference, responsible for 2 of their 3 losses. If Robert Morris can hold the 'Hurst offense at bay they should be able to pull off the win.<br>
__Robert Morris Wins 3-2__

My personal odds of each team winning the title:

* Robert Morris: 40
* Mercyhurst: 35
* RIT: 15
* Syracuse: 10
