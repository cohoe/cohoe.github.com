I am a graduate of the Rochester Institute of Technology in Rochester, New York, USA. I have a B.S. in Applied Networking and System Administration with minors in Database Design, Development, & Implementation and Communication. I was a system administrator with the Computer Science House, a place that without which my life would be completely different. I now work as a System Administrator at RSA (The Security Division of EMC).

## What I do for work

* Holistic Network/System Architecture & Administration
* Logistics & Project Management

I find that knowing how to do stuff is one thing, but being able to document it and show others is much more valuable. This site and a lot of the content in it are my adventures in setting up services in my lines of work. There is no business end behind it. I do this stuff for fun (and profit here and there). The knowledge I have gained from doing these things is invaluable. Learning is a lifelong adventure, so I always look for new opportunities to test my skills and expand my skills.

If there is something you would like me to look into or post about, shoot me an email at grant@grantcohoe.com and I'll see what I can do.

## What I do for fun

* Hockey (watching and playing)
* Music (balalika, domra, accordion, electric bass, flute)
* <a href="http://www.usfirst.org/roboticsprograms/frc">FIRST Robotics Competition</a> volunteer inspector
* <a href="http://www.campcomputer.com">Camp Fitch Computer Camp</a> counselor
