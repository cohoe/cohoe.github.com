I am a student at the Rochester Institute of Technology in Rochester, New York, USA studying Applied Networking and System Administration with minors in Database Design, Development, & Implementation and Communication. I am a system administrator and Chairman of the Computer Science House, a place that without which my life would be completely different. I have interned with the System Technology group at Anheuser-Busch InBev and Engineering Lab Services at RSA Security. 

## What I do for work

* Holistic Network/System Architecture & Administration
* IPv6 Implementation
* Logistics & Project Management

I find that knowing how to do stuff is one thing, but being able to document it and show others is much more valuable. This site and a lot of the content in it are my adventures in setting up services in my lines of work. There is no business end behind it. I do this stuff for fun (and profit here and there). The knowledge I have gained from doing these things is invaluable. And as cool as my major sounds, they do not cover most of the things I talk about or want to learn. 

If there is something you would like me to look into or post about, shoot me an email at grant@grantcohoe.com and I'll see what I can do.

## What I do for fun

* Hockey (watching and playing)
* Music (balalika, domra, accordion, electric bass, flute)
* <a href="http://www.usfirst.org/roboticsprograms/frc">FIRST Robotics Competition</a> volunteer inspector
* <a href="http://www.campcomputer.com">Camp Fitch Computer Camp</a> counselor
