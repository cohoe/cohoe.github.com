I am a student at the Rochester Institute of Technology in Rochester, New York, USA studying Applied Networking and System Administration with minors in Database Design, Development, & Implementation and Communication. I am a system administrator and Chairman of the Computer Science House, a place that without which my life would be completely different. I have interned with the System Technology group at Anheuser-Busch InBev and Engineering Lab Services at RSA Security. 

Some things I am pretty good at include:

* Holistic Network/System Architecture & Administration
* Cloud deployments 
* IPv6 Implementation
* Logistics & Project Management

I find that knowing how to do stuff is one thing, but being able to document it and show others is much more valuable. This site and a lot of the content in it are my adventures in setting up services in my lines of work. There is no business end behind it. I do this stuff for fun (and profit here and there). The knowledge I have gained from doing these things is invaluable. And as cool as my major sounds, they do not cover most of the things I talk about.

If there is something you would like me to look into or post about, shoot me an email at grant@grantcohoe.com and I'll see what I can do.
