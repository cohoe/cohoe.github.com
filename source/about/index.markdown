I am a student at the Rochester Institute of Technology in Rochester, New York, USA studying Applied Networking and System Administration with minors in Database Design, Development, & Implementation and Communication. I am a system administrator and Chairman of the Computer Science House, a place that without which my life would be completely different. Currently I am on an internship with RSA The Security Division of EMC with Engineering Lab Services.

Some things I am pretty good at include:

* System & Network Architecture
* Cloud Platforms
* IPv6 Implementation
* Authentication
* Linux System Administration
* Logistics & Project Management
* Learning new technologies and teaching them back to you

I find that knowing how to do stuff is one thing, but being able to document it and show others is much more valuable. This site and a lot of the content in it are my adventures in setting up services in my lines of work. There is no business end behind it. I do this stuff for fun (and profit here and there). The knowledge I have gained from doing these things is invaluable. And as cool as my major sounds, they do not cover most of the things I talk about.

If there is something you would like me to look into or post about, shoot me an email at cohoe.grant@gmail.com and I'll see what I can do.

If you are an employer looking to add me to your team, you can find my resume here or by clicking the Adobe PDF icon on the home page. You can find more details on my specific skills on the Skills page.
