<p>
Hey world! I'm a system administrator/infrastructure developer living in Boston MA USA. I like technology, hockey, ideas, and people. This website is a record of some of the interesting projects, technologies, and life experiences that I encounter in my travels.
<p>
In the <a href="{{ root_url }}/blog">blog</a> you will find how-to technical guides, resources, and ramblings about life.
The <a href="{{ root_url }}/skills">skills</a> page has a Google Doc with an inventory of the technologies I have worked with. 
You can find out more about me and what I do on the <a href="{{ root_url }}/about">about</a> page.
<p>
So whether you are here to stay or passing through to parts unknown, welcome!
