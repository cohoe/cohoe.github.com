description: System administrator, network engineer, problem solver. Read about some of the interesting projects and technologies that I work with.
---
<p>
Greetings programs! I'm a system administrator (cloud plumber), network engineer (bit wrangler), and problem solver (solution engineer) currently living in Boston MA USA. This website is intended to be a brain dump of any interesting projects, technologies, and life experiences that I encounter. 
<p>
In the <a href="{{ root_url }}/blog">blog</a> you will find guides and writeups on different projects and experiences. These range from how-to technical guides to ramblings about life.
The <a href="{{ root_url }}/skills">skills</a> page has a Google Doc with an inventory of the technologies I have worked with. This gives me a way to quantify what I do and do not know.
You can find out more about me and what I do on the <a href="{{ root_url }}/about">about</a> page.
<p>
So whether you are here to stay or passing through to parts unknown, welcome!
