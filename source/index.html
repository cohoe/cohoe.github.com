Greetings programs! I'm Grant Cohoe, a self-proclaimed cloud plumber, bit wrangler, and solution engineer currently living in Rochester NY USA. I try to document many of projects that I work on for class/fun/work. I also tend to write guides on how to set up certain things so that others can learn, and track all of my skills so that I can quantify what I do and do not know. This website is the public record of all of that stuff.
